# Blender Parameterization Helper

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to host a tool that will take blender code for parameterized modelling of chainmail weaves and return modified code that will model the weave in addition to adding a custom UI allowing you to modify the parameters from a UI and offer a keyboard control method.
